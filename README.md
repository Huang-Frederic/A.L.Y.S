# üìç A.L.Y.S (Aeonian Library for Yearning Seekers)

A.L.Y.S (Aeonian Library for Yearning Seekers) is a full-stack project I'm developing from scratch as a personal challenge in my third year as a developer. This project aims to centralize popular manhwa, manhua, and manga into one platform accessible through both a website and a mobile app. The principle behind A.L.Y.S is to scrape various sites to retrieve artwork and reunite them in one platform. Through meticulous development, we're striving to create a unified space where enthusiasts can indulge in their favorite genres without the hassle of navigating multiple sources.
